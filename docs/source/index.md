# snake-guice's documentation

snake-guice is a simple, lightweight Python dependency injection framework based on google-guice. The Guice way of doing things is quite a bit different than the current breed of XML IoC containers.

We are working toward an official 1.0 release! We are currently in Alpha, but as the APIs become more stable we'll move to Beta.

This documentation is a work in progress. For general information on the Guice concepts you may want to take a look at the [google-guice](https://github.com/google/guice/wiki) project documentation. Just mentally translate the Java examples to Python. Most of the examples are extremely simple anyway.
