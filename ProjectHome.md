snake-guice is a simple, lightweight Python dependency injection framework based on google-guice. The Guice way of doing things is quite a bit different than the current breed of XML IoC containers.

This is experimental code. APIs will likely change and implementation will definitely change.

This documentation is a work in progress. For general information on the Guice concepts you may want to take a look at the [google-guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice) project documentation. Just mentally translate the Java examples to Python. Most of the examples are extremely simple anyway. There are also a couple of great videos explaining the Guice concepts:
